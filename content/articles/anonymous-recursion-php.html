excerpt: For the past few posts, I have been working toward building a useful set of concepts to apply some functional programming techniques in PHP 5.3. In this article, I explore the concept of anonymous recursion, something that becomes important in situations where we are using anonymous functions to solve problems. This technique can be very useful in situations where the usefulness of first-class functions meets the simplicity of recursive algorithms.

Suppose that you found yourself in a situation where using an anonymous function is the best way to solve your current problem. Further suppose that the best way to implement your anonymous function is to use recursion. Maybe, attacking the problem optimistically, you start with something like this:

<?php
$fibonacci = function( $n ) { 
	return ( $n < 2 ) ? $n : ( $fibonacci( $n - 1 ) + $fibonacci( $n - 2 ) );
};
echo $fibonacci(4); // should be (0,1,2,3,4) -> (0,1,1,2,3)
?>

"Well, crap," you say, seeing the @Fatal error@ reported by PHP. Turns out that variables called as function must resolve to either an instance of @Closure@ (an implementation detail that shouldn't be relied upon) or a string when evaluated. In the case above, @$fibonacci@ is a free variable in the closure created by the anonymous function (which closes around no variables, making it something of a degenerate case). When it is called, it has not been bound (even locally) and therefore can't be called as _anything_, let alone a function.

How to proceed? The classical solution would be simply to name this function; instead of binding the function to a variable called @$fibonacci@, we should just _name_ the function @fibonacci@. That would certainly be convenient. But what if we encounter a higher-order function that expects a function as a parameter? It happens that many higher-order functions in PHP can simply accept as callbacks the names of functions, but I prefer not to rely on that. What if we *must* provide the higher-order function with the means of calculating the nth Fibonacci number? How could we even go about implementing the recursion required to pull it off?

I'm so glad you asked. The difficult part about the above is that we have no good way to actually call the function in whose body we are executing while we're still in in. The thing's anonymous, after all--we are essentially looking for some way to break its anonymity. Well, we may not be able to actually extract the name of this function for the purpose of calling it again, but we do have access to the location where it's held in memory. This location is known to @$fibonacci@, the value we're using in the parent scope to hold the function itself. Therefore, if we could grab the value of @$fibonacci@, we could actually use it to recurse.

If you read my article about closures, you would know that we can do something much like this. Using the @use@ keyword in PHP for anonymous function definition, we can pull either a value or a reference into a function's scope. Let's be naive and pull in the value of @$fibonacci@ in a forshadowingly misguided attempt to recurse:

<?php
$fibonacci = function( $n ) use ( $fibonacci ) {
	return ( $n < 2 ) ? $n : ( $fibonacci( $n - 1 ) + $fibonacci( $n - 2 ) );
};
echo $fibonacci(4); // Fatal error: Function name must be a string
?>

This new function actually has the exact same body as our original attempt; the only difference is that we are now pulling in the value of @$fibonacci@ from the parent scope and binding it at definition-time. Running this, we actually get the exact same error we got above. Why?

Without going into the nitty gritty details of the PHP parser, let's talk through what's happening here. First, we are declaring a variable called @$fibonacci@ and then assigning to it the anonymous function; however, this function statement doesn't terminate until _after_ the value of @$fibonacci@ is pulled into its body and used. Since we are @use@ing @$fibonacci@ by value (and not by reference, as we'll see momentarily), that value is @null@ at the point we actually need to use it. Notice that there is no fatal error here _until_ we actually execute @$fibonacci()@. That's very important.

Seeing that this doesn't work, let's make another improvement: let's use @$fibonacci@ by reference (in functional parlance, let's close our anonymous function over @$fibonacci@). By doing so, we're still pulling @$fibonacci@ into our function before it actually holds anything useful. However, because we are closing by reference, rather than by value, @$fibonacci@ will be properly defined by the time we actually need to run it. Remember how we didn't get the error by value until we executed the function? That problem goes away now, because by the time we execute the function, the variable holding it for us is _actually_ holding it for us.

<?php
$fibonacci = function( $n ) use ( &$fibonacci ) {
	return ( $n < 2 ) ? $n : ( $fibonacci( $n - 1 ) + $fibonacci( $n - 2 ) );
};
echo $fibonacci(4); // Outputs "2"
?>

Now that we have a working recursive anonymous function, let's explore some examples of what we can do with it. One nice thing about this particular implementation (which emphatically isn't due to its anonymous nature, but rather by design) is that it is completely non-destructive (and might even get a hat tip or two from functional aficianados). Here are two applications:

Map:

Functional programming in PHP is a whole 'nother level of ugly. Here's an implementation of @map@, a higher-order function which takes a single-argument function and applies it to each element in a collection. Here, we pass it @$fibonacci@, which holds our recursive anonymous function.

<?php
function map( $f, array $seq, array $mapped = array() ) {
	if( !empty( $seq ) ) $mapped[] = $f( reset( $seq ) );
	return !empty( $seq ) ? map( $f, array_slice( $seq, 1 ), $mapped ) : $mapped;
}
print_r( map( $fibonacci, range( 1, 5 ) ) ); // Maps integers to Fibs
?>

Reduce:

@reduce@ is another common higher-order function, which takes a function of two arguments and runs pairs of values from the passed collection, mapping the array pairwise into a single value.

<?php
function reduce( $f, array $seq, $s = 0 ) {
	$s = !empty( $seq ) ? $f( $s, reset( $seq ) ) : $s;
	return !empty( $seq ) ? reduce( $f, array_slice( $seq, 1 ), $s ) : $s;
}

echo reduce( function($a,$b){ return $a+$b; }, map( $fibonacci, range( 1, 5 ) ), 0 ); // Outputs 12
?>

If we were in a situation where we needed to make use of a higher-order function like one of these above, it would be very inconvenient to be limited to only using anonymous functions which could not be written recursively. With these "pass-by-reference closures" in PHP, we can circumvent that limitation and provide our anonymous function to any higher-order function that can use it.

This is still a somewhat poor solution, however, because our functions are no longer truly anonymous. Instead of binding the name of the function to an identifier, we are binding the name of our function to a variable. In case we wanted to change the name of the function, or provide recursion like this in an inner-anonymous function, we might struggle.

Next time, I'll talk about how we can implement anonymous recursion in PHP 5.3 without using this language-level trick by using the Y combinator.

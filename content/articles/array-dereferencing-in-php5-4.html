excerpt: When functions and methods in PHP 5 return objects, it is easy to "dereference" these values directly from the method call using the @->@ operator. Without this feature, one would have to assign the returned object to a variable, and then dereference from the variable. Unfortunately, one cannot dereference from return values in general; this is a frustration when one wants to use array indices directly, for example. Fortunately, PHP 5.4 introduces the ability to dereference array return values directly.

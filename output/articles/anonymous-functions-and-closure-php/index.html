                    <h1>Anonymous functions and closure in PHP</h1>
                    <h3>By Ryan on  in <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/php" rel="tag">php</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/closure" rel="tag">closure</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/anonymous functions" rel="tag">anonymous functions</a></h3>
                    
                    <p><span class="caps">PHP</span> 5.3 introduced function literals to the language, providing big benefits in the form of syntax and readability when using and creating functions that accept other functions as arguments. However, the introduction of <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php">anonymous functions</a> was paired with another useful language construct which allows us to close over local variables in the same scope as the anonymous function, creating a closure.</p>
<h2>What is closure?</h2>
<p>According to Wikipedia, a <strong>closure</strong> is a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>function together with a referencing environment for the nonlocal names (free variables) of that function</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A closure is so-called because it is <em>closed over</em> its free variables. These free variables, or <em>upvalues</em>, come from the enclosing scope of the anonymous function and persist even after that scope, and all references to it, is otherwise made unavailable (e.g., by the function execution completing and returning control back to the previous frame).</p>
<p>What does this mean for you, as a <span class="caps">PHP</span> developer? If you&#8217;re only using vanilla functions to read in and act upon or modify global variables, then probably not much. You can already do something functionally <em>similar</em> (emphasis) to this using the much-maligned <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php#language.variables.scope.global"><code>global</code> keyword</a> to import variable references from the global scope. However, when working somewhere other than the global scope&#8212;or when using anonymous functions&#8212;closures are a powerfully expressive means for performing many otherwise tedious and complicated tasks.</p>
<h2>What isn&#8217;t closure?</h2>
<p>First, let&#8217;s walk through an example of using the <code>global</code> keyword in a function defined in the global namespace as a basis for comparison against the closures we&#8217;ll talk about momentarily.</p>
<h3>The <code>global</code> keyword</h3>
<p>Suppose you are writing a function that, for some <em>good</em> reason, requires you to change a variable defined outside of the function&#8217;s scope. We can import the variable from the global scope into the function scope using the <code>global</code> keyword, like so:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1084089.js?file=basic-global.php"></script><p>The output of this script would be <code>1</code>. The <code>global</code> keyword imports a reference to the global variable <code>$count</code>, whose value at that time is <code>0</code>, into the function scope. The global variable itself is then incremented. Because we have imported and incremented a reference, this function actually modifies something in the global namespace.</p>
<p>A naive reading of the definition of <em>closure</em> above might lead one to think that this fits the bill. However, the implementation details are slightly different; <span class="caps">PHP</span> has a <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php">superglobal</a> variable named <code>$GLOBALS</code> that is accessible from within any scope. The <code>global $var</code> construct is simply syntactic sugar for the much uglier <code>$var = &amp;$GLOBALS['var'];</code> expression, which would have the same effect. Because this is simply a reference to a superglobal, we could in principle observe manipulation of this variable from another source, outside of the function. This is not closure.</p>
<h3>Scope within a scope</h3>
<p>Another reason this does not create closure is due to the fact that, no matter within which scope you currently operate, <code>global</code> imports only references from the <em>global</em> namespace (due to the implementation reality outlined above). For example, a function within a function cannot import scope from its parent using <code>global</code>, but only from the global namespace.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1084089.js?file=global-inner-function.php"></script><p>Running the program above will output <code>1 1</code> (no spaces). This shows that <code>global</code> imports variables only from the global namespace, not just from the &#8220;parent&#8221; namespace. Closure would require either the <code>global</code> statement to grab from the next-highest namespace, or simply allow the parent scope to creep into the child scope (another style of scoping entirely, a la javascript). This is not closure.</p>
<h3>Anonymous functions</h3>
<p>Is an anonymous function a closure, then? Anonymous functions and closures are often conflated, but they are distinct concepts. I think the garden path I&#8217;ve been leading you on so far should have steered you away from this, but let&#8217;s just make sure. We know that simply using <code>global</code> isn&#8217;t closure because of its implementation-that it doesn&#8217;t actually close over variables within the function-defining scope, it just brings them into the current scope by reference. Anonymous functions are still functions, and <code>global</code> operates within them the same way it operates within named functions. Anonymous functions are not closures.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m unclear on the low-level implementation details of functions versus anonymous functions in <span class="caps">PHP</span> 5.3, but there is no practical difference in terms of the ostensible constraints they face in terms of scope, input, and output. For example:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1084089.js?file=function-literal-global.php"></script><p>The only meaningful difference here is that <code>increase_count</code> is given a name at define-time, while <code>$increase_count_again</code> is assigned a function literal which is executed by variable name at run time. They both face the same rules <em>vis-a-vis</em> <code>global</code>, and the fact that this script outputs <code>2</code> is proof of that.</p>
<h2>The <code>use</code> keyword</h2>
<p>So what is closure? You&#8217;ve been reading long enough now that you might suspect I&#8217;ve eliminated every possible misconception and misunderstanding that could possible arise. That&#8217;s not true; closure is a difficult concept to grasp, and misunderstanding it can lead to misuse, which can introduce hard-to-detect bugs.</p>
<p>Closure requires both a function, with its own scope, and a surrounding environment which persists through an arbitrary number of executions of that function. So, an anonymous function is insufficient. In order to produce a closure, we need to be able to create the surrounding environment. Luckily, <span class="caps">PHP</span> 5.3 also introduced a very useful construct for turning anonymous functions into closures.</p>
<h3><code>use</code> by value</h3>
<p>The <code>use</code> keyword, when paired with a function literal&#8212;or anonymous function&#8212;allows us to import variable values or references into the scope of the function. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1084089.js?file=simple-naive-closure-value.php"></script><p>We use <code>$count</code> by value, so the output of the script is <code>1</code>. This is because <span class="caps">PHP</span> binds a function-local variable named <code>$count</code> to the value of the parent-local <code>$count</code> at the time the function literal is defined. Even if we change the value of the parent-local <code>$count</code> (say, by incrementing it between defining <code>$decrease_count</code> and calling it), its value within the function body will not change. This also implies that changing <code>$count</code> in the function-local scope will have no effect on the value of <code>$count</code> in the parent-local scope. This is not closure.</p>
<h3><code>use</code> by reference</h3>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1084089.js?file=simple-naive-closure-reference.php"></script><p>I keep using the phrase &#8220;by value or reference&#8221; because either is possible. Notice in the example above that I have prefixed <code>$count</code> with <code>&amp;</code>, the <span class="caps">PHP</span> symbol that makes an assignment <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.references.pass.php">by reference</a>. The output of the above script is as expected: <code>$count</code> from the parent-local scope is decremented in the function-local scope and the printed result is <code>0</code>. Notice especially that this particular script need not be defined in the global namespace (the file in which it&#8217;s defined could be included in a function, for example); <code>use</code> always refers to the scope in which the function is defined. This is closure.</p>
<p>More basically, you might ask: how is this any different from using <code>global</code> inside a function defined in the global namespace? The most important way is that it allows us to import a value or reference from the immediate-parent scope, not just the global scope. The tuple following the <code>use</code> keyword tells <span class="caps">PHP</span> to import values or references to each element into the function scope.</p>
<p>Ok, so you can import variables by reference into anonymous functions. What&#8217;s the big deal? Well, now that you understand many of the things that <em>aren&#8217;t</em> closure (and have an example of something that technically <em>is</em> closure), let&#8217;s see what you can do with it.</p>
<h2>Usage of closure</h2>
<p>Under usual circumstances and in many languages, any variable allocated within a function body is lost when that function&#8217;s execution is completed, because the frame containing it is popped (although this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6441218/can-a-local-variables-memory-be-accessed-outside-its-scope">isn&#8217;t exactly right in all languages</a>). Within a closure, however, we can maintain and manipulate the information created inside of an enclosing function even after that enclosing function has finished execution. Check out the following example:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1084089.js?file=full-closure-count.php"></script><p>In this script, the body of the <code>create_closure</code> function has a local variable named <code>$count</code>. <code>create_closure</code> returns an anonymous function which has by-reference access to this local variable. Therefore, where references to @create_closure@&#8217;s <code>$count</code> would typically lose all meaning when its body was finished executing, there now remains a reference to it <em>within</em> any variable to which the anonymous function is assigned. <strong><code>create_closure</code> creates a closure because it returns a function together with a referencing environment for the nonlocal names of that function</strong>. This is closure.</p>
<p>Notice the output of the above (shown inline as comments). We call the anonymous function three times, and the output changes each time, even though the body of the anonymous function really does nothing interesting. <code>$closure</code> has &#8220;closed over&#8221; <code>$count</code> and now has local access to it for any call to <code>$closure()</code>.</p>
<h2>More advanced usage</h2>
<p>What if we generate multiple closures; how is this handled? I&#8217;m so glad you asked.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1084089.js?file=full-closure-count-2.php"></script><p>We now create two different closures. You noticed, of course, that the function generating the closures is parameterized by <code>$count</code>. Since we call this function twice&#8212;each time with a different parameter value&#8212;it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that we will receive two separate closures, each closed over a different value for <code>$count</code>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Anonymous functions and closures are a very neat and powerful addition to <span class="caps">PHP</span> 5.3. I hope after reading this article you better understand how to use these new language features, and maybe even have a better idea of why they&#8217;re a big improvement over what was previously available. This article is meant to serve as a basic introduction and overview of the language-level characteristics of closures. Let me know what you think!</p>

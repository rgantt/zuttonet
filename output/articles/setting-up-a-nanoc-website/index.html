                    <h3>By Ryan in <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ruby" rel="tag">ruby</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/nanoc" rel="tag">nanoc</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/static" rel="tag">static</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/guide" rel="tag">guide</a></h3>
                    
                    <p>Nanoc is fantastic. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. However, any time I approach something new on a computer, there&#8217;s always a struggle between the information available in the documentation (typically written by the developer, who already knows what&#8217;s up) and the information I really need to know to use the software.</p>
<h2>Minor frustrations</h2>
<p>The first thing that tripped me up about nanoc was how best to handle my images and other binary files. I think the documentation talks about binary files a bit, but I was left a little confused even after several reads through. I knew that the standard nanoc metadata couldn&#8217;t simply be added to the top of the file, but I had trouble figuring out how to get the files where I wanted them to go. A little trial and error helped, but the biggest breakthrough came after I worked with the process as a whole. What follows here is an example of my compilation and routing rules for my basic images and the rest of the files on my site.</p>
<h2>Compilation and routing</h2>
<p>Basically, nanoc consists of two steps: compilation and routing.</p>
<h3>Compilation</h3>
<p><strong>Compilation</strong>, the way I see it, is the process of taking particular items (this is actually how they&#8217;re called in nanoc parlance) and transforming their contents according to specific rules. These rules are created by you. To help you, nanoc provides a bunch of built-in helpers (nicely packaged functionality for generating stuff on your site) and filters (formatting rules, etc, through which your pages are run&#8212;e.g. markdown, textile) while exposing a simple api for accessing each item as given. Compilation can be as complicated as translating into another language or as simple as a pass-through. The articles on this site, for example, are simply passed through RedCloth (a Ruby textile implementation) and written.</p>
<h3>Routing</h3>
<p>After all of the items are compiled and linked, they&#8217;re routed. <strong>Routing</strong> is the process of actually putting the compiled files where they need to go. Routing rules match item identifiers (in the same way that compilation rules do) and allow you to return a string different than the identifier itself. Ultimately, the item placed in a subdirectory <code>/output/</code> according to the string you return in the routing rule matching that file. Routing <code>/foo/</code> to <code>/pages/foo/</code> for example, will cause the output file to be placed in <code>pages/foo/index.html</code> instead of <code>foo/index.html</code> by default. You could also route <code>/foo/</code> to <code>/foo.html</code> if you wanted. The routing rule is given an item object to work with, which includes data about the identifier, the path, the extension, and other things.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a subset of the compilation and routing rules I use for the index page and the articles for this website:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1012755.js?file=compile_and_route_articles.rb"></script><h3>Root pages</h3>
<p>First first rule catches the html files in the content/ directory, filters them through <code>:erb</code> (the standard filter you&#8217;d want to apply if you were doing any sort of ruby <span class="caps">ERB</span> markup in the page). Since I want to build my index.html to dynamically list the most recent articles using Ruby, this is the appropriate filter. Then I apply the <code>page</code> layout (which is another erb file located in <code>layouts/</code>). Once a file has matched a compilation rule, it won&#8217;t be run through any others.</p>
<h3>Articles</h3>
<p>Articles follow the same basic guideline, except they&#8217;re filtered through <code>:redcloth</code> (the textile filter) since they contain no &#8220;dynamic&#8221; content. I say &#8220;dynamic&#8221; because even the <code>:erb</code> stuff from above becomes static <span class="caps">HTML</span> during the compilation process. The <code>article</code> layout is applied to these files. Both root pages and articles are then simply routed based on their identifiers (so their relative directory structure does not change).</p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>Now, Back to images: images require no compilation, because (in some sense) they&#8217;re already compiled. In fact, if we want to avoid problems during our file compilation process, we will need to <em>prevent</em> any sort of compilation from being done to them. The easiest way to do this is to set up an empty rule; a rule block that does nothing. Failure to do this will result in the images being compiled by your default rule; if this default rule does anything that might break on a binary file, the whole compilation process will fail.</p>
<p>After passing through the compilation process, binary files must be routed to their final destination. In my situation, I wanted to be able to access all of my images with a route (or absolute <span class="caps">URI</span>) that resembled <code>"/images/name.ext"</code>. Easy enough-I set up a rule that routes all files in the <code>/content/images</code> directory of my nanoc install to <code>/output/images/name.ext</code> (including any subdirectory names).</p>
<p>Here are the compilation and routing rules I use for basic images on this website:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1012755.js?file=compile_and_route_images.rb"></script><p>Looking at the routing rules, it might seem like nanoc is just wasting time-after all, why would I not just put the files in the output structure that I want to begin with? The real value in the routing defaults, as I see it, is that nanoc prefers to rename files to <code>index.html</code> and place them in a subdirectory that corresponds to the old filename. This is useful, because instead of having to type a url like: <code>zuttonet.com/pages/contact.html</code>, you can simply make your request for <code>zuttonet.com/pages/contact</code> instead (provided that <code>index.html</code> is set as your web server&#8217;s default file to serve when a directory is requested). Pretty cool!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>nanoc is great for setting up a small-to-medium sized website that really doesn&#8217;t need to serve dynamic content. Blogs come straight to mind. Adding comments and trackbacks to a static nanoc website is as easy as setting up a disqus account and plopping some async code in your template. Have fun!</p>
